# CCproject
This is the client-side of FarmingHelper APP, which is used to attend the [Climate Change Competition2019](https://climatechange.tw/Creative/CompetitionMethod).The work is completed together with another [React version](https://github.com/qa4510qa/midterm_FarmingHelper), which is used to be the midterm project of WebProg2019. 

## Overview
FarmingHelper is a cross-platform app for agriculture.
Users can get the optimized answer of when and what to grow simply by entering some information, the available dates, location, considering crops, considering climate factors, crop prices, ...etc.
After entering the data and clicking "Enter", the answer, together with the alternative price of each considering crop, will come up.
FarmingHelper also provides future climate data, which is generated by ourself using the method from SDLab and the data from Central Weather Bureau, and crop data for users to refer to when cropping.
The application supports MacOS, Windows, and IOS now.
* Note:The work is under developing, so there are still some errors in back-end.

## Framework used
* [React](https://reactjs.org/) - The web framework used
* [React-Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) - The framework used to build native mobile app in IOS 
* [Node](https://nodejs.org/) - The run-time JavaScript environment for developing back-end services.
* [Express](https://expressjs.com) - A node package for handling HTTP request with a series of middlewares.

## How to build
For [IOS](https://github.com/qa4510qa/CCproject) (developing in Mac)
1. Please find the server machine and follow [this](https://github.com/qa4510qa/midterm_FarmingHelperServer) README to deploy the server.
2. Turn back to your local computer.
3. Make sure you have NPM(^6.4.1) and Node(^10.15.3) installed.
4. Please follow the [React-Native Getting Started](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started) to make a environment for developing React-Native App.
5. `cd CCproject`
6. In src/const/AppConfig.const.js, set SERVER_IP to `<your server's IP or domain>`.
7. `react-native run ios` to run in debugging mode.

* Note:When you run `react-native run ios`, an Xcode simulator will pop up and simulate your app on an iphone.

For [MacOS and Windows](https://github.com/qa4510qa/midterm_FarmingHelper/blob/master/README.md)
1. Please find the server machine and follow [this](https://github.com/qa4510qa/midterm_FarmingHelperServer) README to deploy the server.
2. Turn back to your local computer.
3. Make sure you have NPM() and Node() installed.
4. `cd midterm_FarmingHelper`
5. `npm i`
6. `npm start` to run in debugging mode.
7. `npm run make` to generate executable APP for your platform.
